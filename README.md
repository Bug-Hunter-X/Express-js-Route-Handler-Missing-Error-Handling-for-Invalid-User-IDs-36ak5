# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the `/users/:id` route lacks validation for the `id` parameter, making it vulnerable to crashes or unexpected behavior if a non-numeric ID is passed.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Problem

The original code attempts to parse the `userId` as an integer directly using `parseInt()`. If the `userId` is not a valid integer (e.g., a string), `parseInt()` will return `NaN`, leading to the `users.find()` method failing silently or throwing an error depending on the data and its handling.  This results in an inconsistent user experience and potential application instability.

## Solution

The solution adds comprehensive error handling:

1. **Input Validation:** The `userId` is checked to ensure it is a valid number. 
2. **Error Handling:** If the `userId` is invalid, an appropriate error message (e.g., 400 Bad Request) is returned.
3. **User Not Found:**  If a user with the provided ID is not found, a 404 Not Found response is returned.

This improved error handling ensures robustness and a better user experience.
